Q-SYS Plugin: Text Typewriter plugin

This module is a control program for displaying text in a typewriter-style manner. The main features are as follows:

1. It features the ability to display text in a typewriter style at a specified speed.
   The display speed can be adjusted based on the number of characters or lines in the text.
2. As the text is being displayed, an animation is triggered where the currently displayed portion scrolls and changes.
3. After the text scrolling is completed, if loop playback is enabled, it will start again; otherwise, the display will stop.
4. While the text is being displayed, if specific characters or keywords are present, corresponding colors can be applied to them.
5. The color palette can be used to change the colors applied to the displayed text.

Each functionality is provided through GUI controls, and the display and animations are controlled based on changes in the state of these controls.
Additionally, text and color settings can be configured through the GUI.

The code includes event handlers for changes in GUI control states, text updates, adjustment of animation speeds, and color settings for the text.

In summary, this plugin is a control program for displaying text in a typewriter-style manner with animation effects.
